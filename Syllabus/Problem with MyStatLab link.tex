\section*{Problem with MyStatLab link on D2L}

If you click on the ``Open MyLab \& Mastering" and nothing seems to happen, the problem is likely popup blocking in your browser.\\

\begin{itemize}
\item In Chrome if popup blocking is enabled, which it is by default, when a site tries to open a popup page a small icon will appear in the address bar.\\

{\centering
\includegraphics[width=5in]{popup_blocked}
\par}
\medskip

\item Click on the icon in the address bar to allow popups from this site.\\

{\centering
\includegraphics[width=5in]{allow_popup}
\par}
\medskip

\item The process should be similar in other browsers.
\end{itemize}
