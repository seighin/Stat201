\section*{Group Work - Chapter 11}
\paragraph{1} M\&Ms are expected to have the following distribution:\\
\smallskip
{\centering
\begin{tabular}{r | c c c c c c }
Color & Blue & Brown & Green & Orange & Red & Yellow\\
Percent & 24\% & 14\% & 15\% & 20\% & 13\% & 14\% 
\end{tabular}
\par} 
\begin{enumalpha}
\item What is the minimum number of M\&Ms needed to do a valid goodness-of-fit test against the expected distribution. In other words, what is the sample size $n$ so that the smallest expected value is at least 5?
\vspace{2.5in}
\item Conduct a goodness-of-fit test of whether the distribution of M\&Ms is what is claimed by the company at a significance level of $\alpha=0.05$. Make sure to state the null and alternative hypotheses, and your conclusion in context of question.
\end{enumalpha}



\newpage
\paragraph{2} The Tortilla and Cheese Organization (TACO) thinks that preferences for types of tacos are the same for men and women. They conduct a survey and collect the following data (``taco\_preference.csv" on D2L):\\
\medskip
{\centering
\begin{tabular}{c | c  c c c}
\multicolumn{1}{c}{} & \multicolumn{4}{c}{\large Type of taco}\\
Gender & Beef & Pork & Chicken & Fish\\
\hline
Men & 105 & 34 & 56 & 27\\
Women & 83 & 29 & 75 & 35 \\
\end{tabular}
\par}
\bigskip
Test the claim the taco preference is the same for men and women at $\alpha = 0.05$ level of significance. Make sure to state the null and alternative hypotheses, and your conclusion in context of question.

\vspace{3.25in}
\paragraph{3} The file ``hair\_eye.csv" on D2L contains data on the hair color, eye color and gender for statistics students. Test whether there is an association between hair color and gender at significance level $\alpha=0.05$. Make sure to state the null and alternative hypotheses, and your conclusion in context of question. Is there an association between eye color and gender?
